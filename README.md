# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

## Itroduction

In this repo I have posted my Course Project for the Coursera class Getting and Cleaning Data. Included should be the following:

1. UCI HAR Zip file
2. README.txt (this file)
3. run_activity.R (the actual assignment)
4. a CodeBook.md (more detailed information on the dataset, etc)
5. tidyData.txt

## The Data

The data included with this course project is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. Please see the CodeBook for more details.

## The TidyData

A second requirement for this project was to have the code create a new "tidy" data file.
